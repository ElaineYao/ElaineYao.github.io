Hello, I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu). My research interests are the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning.

I obtained my Master of Applied Science in [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca) in 2024. I was advised by [Prof. Karthik Pattabiraman](https://blogs.ubc.ca/karthik/). I have also worked with [Prof. Caroline Lemieux](https://www.carolemieux.com/) as a Research Assistant. I received my B.Eng from [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn) in 2021. Before joining Cornell, I was a Security Researcher at [Fortinet](https://www.fortinet.com).

<!-- My research interests broadly lie in the area of Cyber-physical systems security (e.g., drone swarms, drones, self-driving vehicles) and test-driven security. Currently, I am focusing on finding vulnerabilities in various systems via fuzz testing.  -->

<!-- **I am looking for a PhD position starting from 2023 fall or 2024 spring!** -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
