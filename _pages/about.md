Hello, I am a second-year Master of Applied Science (MASc) student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. 
I am advised by Prof. Karthik Pattabiraman. 
I received my B.Eng from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. 
My research interests are Cyber-Physical Systems security and software testing.
I am particularly interested in applying graph theory to solve traditional security problems.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
